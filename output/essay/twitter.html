  <h1>Twitter's "shadowbanning"</h1>
<p><span id="date">2018-03-30</span></p>
<p>I have a fairly small Twitter account with less 200 followers, and very few of my own tweets there; my main usage of the site is through replying and retweeting, mostly banalities.</p>
<p>"Shadowbanning" is a practice in which an operator of an online service will not tell a user that she has been restricted, and the restriction is also similarly invisible (unless one looks hard) to others - this is because the restriction is censorship. The "shadow" part originates in the fact that the ban is done in secret <em>and</em> the user affected may not know it is happening. However, one can verify by logging out (and perhaps browsing the service from a different IP), asking others to check, or using an automated online tool (I don't know how those work).</p>
<p>I am not the first to notice that the practice of shadowbanning is much harsher than the regular form of ban, because the affected user may spend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/351buo/tifu_by_posting_for_three_years_and_just_now/">years</a> being banned in such a way - i.e the key component is that she doesn't know. While this is obviously effective against serial offenders (who have already been banned and told about it), it shouldn't go without question; it leaves at least two important questions open: what post caused the ban, and how long is the ban supposed to last?</p>
<p>Hacker News (along with Reddit) is another website known to shadowban, but I am not aware of it occuring before a warning has already been given.</p>
<p>I found out that I was shadowbanned, after some time trying to figure out why certain people couldn't see my tweets; the knowledge came together when I made a "follow Friday" tweet (in which one mentions several people one would recommend others to follew); although a couple of people could see my tweet, I received multiple replies that others couldn't. Another user pointed out that I had been shadowbanned when I said the issue was recurring.</p>
<p>Web searching for the causes of shadowbanning turned up fruitless; a "violation of the terms of service" (deliciously vague, in usual corporate-speak) is sufficient for one to be shadowbanned, though according to some the ban can come from one's tweets being reported in sufficient quantity, or one's followers blocking one's account.</p>
<p>I was not able to find out the reason I was shadowbanned, nor for how long the censorship may last.</p>
<hr>
<p>Amidst the fairly basic complaints a more important point is totally obscured (and frequently missed by people who might have stopped writing earlier), that is, the amount of control that such services have over our communications. I am not alone in meeting most if not all of my followers on Twitter <em>through</em> Twitter; it is also typical that one only communicates with one's followers through Twitter; this gives Twitter near total control (only saved by inviting one's friend to another platform, moving the problem down the line) over communication between two people.</p>
<p>Being aware of such total control (and how could one not be given the number of accounts that Twitter suspends and bans?) will colour the interactions one conducts on the platform. The instruments of regulation and administration, just like in our real world societies, are passed to the users, or in the case of real societies, the people.</p>
<p>But the power of Twitter comes in a strange way we are not accustomed to in society; although individual users have the ability to block whomever they want to (and to subscribe to "block lists", i.e lists of usersnames curated by others), Twitter itself can apply a global block (whether that be in the form of a permanent ban, a suspension, or a shadow ban); perhaps analogues in society might be that I can block Mallory from calling my phone number (or subscribe to a list with her name on it) but the administrators of my society (the state) can't completely block communication between Mallory and any other person. Real life only has block lists, it doesn't (and can't) have shadowbans.</p>
<p>In my judgement, this places a lot of power in the hans of online services, especially with new forms of relationships cropping up which depend on the service itself.</p>
