I am a pseudonymous programmer, lethargic leftist, jaded Japanese learner, ennuying ECE student, mediocre music maker, philanderer with philosophy and apathetic art "consumer".

  <li>"Unseen 1960s Photos of London’s East End" "Nearly all of Granick’s work was shot on Kodachrome 64, a type of color film that has now been discontinued. “The rarity of archival color pictures is what makes these so unique,” says Dorley-Brown. “Thank God he shot on Kodachrome, it’s so stable that they are as good as the day they were shot and it digitizes very well.”" <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pictures-london-east-end-1960s-color">https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pictures-london-east-end-1960s-color</a></li>

<h3>Poetry</h3>
<h4>0. Poems</h4>
<pre>Recursive titling is my thing now
Writing help me forget my problems
My mind can't think how
Stanzas arrange themselves into columns

Finding rhymes in abstract
"Words are like bats"
A non-conformant line for you to scoff at</pre>

<h4>1. Deutsch</h4>
<pre>S-stutter and
A thick Schwäbian accent
Bright eyes of his student band
Schelling sits front, discontent

Take up chair at Berlin
Counteract this Hegelianism
Your coat made of sheepskin
"Degrades science to bare formalism"</pre>

<h4>2. Bike Chain</h4>
<pre>Bike chain, rusty chain
Muddy chain, not coming off,
D'Angelo's bass
Friends is nothing
Music is nothing
Geist is nothing
Bike chain is nothing
"Bike chain" is nothing

I'm up all night, eyes match nettle
Some stay up too, dockleaf contacts maybe
Clean one thousand bike chains
Not if it rains

Avolition who sits with
Jim O'Rourke on repeat
Not giving up isn't a feat
To say I'm trying anyway is cheat

"Just do it" its scream
Fuck, it isn't what it seems
I'm going to fail, tears well up
Bike chain in muddy cup.</pre>

<h4>3. What?</h4>
<pre>A whole day of my life
24 hours are gone
365 days in a year
let's assume it's not a leap year, hm?
80 (70?) years in a life
Tension, DO and NOT-DO
Their reconciliation in poem
What have I done this week
This month
This year
21 years</pre>

<h4>4. Hold it</h4>
<pre>Hold it up so all can see
I dreamed grandfather
I wrote a poem
There is still a pain in my knee

Formed & formless
Separation from loved is stressful
Association with the unbeloved is stressful
Sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress and despair
Buddha Quotes Trademark

Leave me be when nobody talks
Let me dream, talk to
me
please

Amicus omnibus amicus nemeni
Right? Do you feel like me
At home at night
Formed & formless
Nama-rupa Name & form
Dreaming grandfather

No need for crying
Life is flying, dying.</pre>

<h4>5. Bedsit</h4>
<pre>Electric humming pervades her body
Enters via eyes and ears
Blue light of screen reflecting idolatry
Her bed time nears

Does she have a hobby?
What does she do next?
Her Weetabix gone soggy
About this she has to text

Pink pajamas are fittingly female
I search through her tapes for ambience
Alice in Monsterland leaves a breadcrumb trail
Her mind has a problem with transients

Even pigs suffer
Looking around her room before bed
She sees that vegan poster
In her dreams the cows lightly tread

Hand snakes down to that most important place
Imagining the look on her girlfriend's face</pre>

<h4>6. Drum</h4>
<pre>"In a world gone blind
I beat the drum of the deathless"
Such is spoken, beautiful allegory
No shaggy dog stories
Nameless venerable sir

Fulfill, fulfill! Commodity screeching
Innocent child, tick of Value sucks from her back
Oh she is individual
Oh she is allowed
To play the lyre
with plectrum!
with fingers!
throw it into the fires!

Don't talk to me about Nintendo Switch
Nor your kitsch, "ironic" right?
Little man with the turban
A lawyer in Durban

I heard Postone died
or was that just a rumour?
I wouldn't have cried
wouldn't have tried
Marx's benign tumor
He had no humor!

Bare my soul
In poems I could figure
I really hate this literature
It's taken its toll

Gegenstand, understand?
Supersensible world the <i>Absolute</i>
crude concrete en croute
The night in which all cows are black
Tick of value sucks from her back</pre>

<h4>7. Romanian court</h4>
<pre>March sixteen twenty eighteen
Romanian court rejects man's claim he's alive
Unity of body and mind
Descartes' vending machine.

Freeman and slave
Patrician and plebian
Lord and serf
Guild-master and journeyman
Oppressor and oppressed

He forgot one: mind and work
All desire freedom from bondage
Old Bakunin, worm turns under his boot
I'd rather be a slave
if I could get a good grade.</pre>

<h4>8. Platōnicus</h4>
<pre>A friend to all (amicus omnibus)
Arm around me, come Communist
Let's talk, let's eat
Warmth I lost in the driveway garage
Turn into Colsehill Parkway
I'll meet you there, a handshake he'll manage

I'll love you (not in that way)
Nothing between us, not one wafer
Atoms silicon close together
Talk lighter than a feather

Synonymous with non-adulterous
It doesn't have to be anomalous
Amore Platōnicus</pre>

<h4>9. Livre de David Allen</h4>
<pre>Bird-song and stream-sound
Fuck me, it's just my alarm
To my side a treasure to be found
A girl who I couldn't harm

I don't like doing;
Žižek voice
Ish it not prishaishly ze bourgeois preshur purshuing?
Come on, it's not my choice

This is just the way I find myself
Even your naked body is
a doing thing, do it to yourself
Fine, here's a kiss

Don't get up, don't get dressed
For me, this pace of life is the best</pre>

<h4>10. Legislature</h4>
<pre>Bustling crows
Soulless mass
Ignorant gland
Oligarchic kapitalist
Backbencher sloucher
Skinless face</pre>
